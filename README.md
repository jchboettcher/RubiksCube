RUBIKS CUBE

(adapted from The Coding Train - Coding Challenge 142 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PGfL4t-uqE)


HOW TO USE

For dimensions up to 10x10x10 use the keys "qwertyuiop" to turn the corresponding face in the x plane, "asdfghjkl;" in the y plane, and "zxcvbnm,./" in the z plane (smaller dimensions use keys farthest to the left, e.g. 3x3x3 only uses "qwe", "asd", and "zxc").

Hold SHIFT to turn a face in the opposite direction.

The ENTER key toggles between animated mode and non-animated mode.

The "\\" (backslash) key scrambles the cube with a string of random moves. (can customize the number of random moves in the main file)

The SPACE bar solves the cube. (Note: this is not a genuine solver, it just applies all the moves the user has done in reverse order until it is back to the solved state.)

Other customizations are explained in the main file RubiksCube.pde.
